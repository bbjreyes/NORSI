# NORSI
The premise of the application is one of the utmost importance: prevent RSI (hence NORSI (NO RSI)). Let your hands take a break, if only for a second! 

NORSI uses an XML file in the 'Data' folder as its source for those words that should be recognised when spoken. Matched commands are actioned using a key sequence also loaded into this file. Any additional functionality can be added by only accessing the XML file alone, meaning you don't need to get your hands dirty in code to make use of NORSI.

As the 'help' message points out within the application, when stating a command such as 'System Switch' to change windows (alt-tab), using 'Set Default' allows the selected word to be expected meaning just 'Switch' will operate correctly if 'System' has been set as the default keyword.

Happy playing!
